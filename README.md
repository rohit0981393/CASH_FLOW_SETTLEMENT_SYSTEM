# Cash_flow_optimizer-
A C++ based optimization tool to minimize inter-bank cash transfers using balance analysis and payment mode compatibility
-- Tech Stack Used: C++, STL (set, map, vector), Graph Theory, Greedy Algorithms.
-- Calculated net balances using an adjacency matrix to minimize redundant monetary transactions across international banks
-- Applied a greedy flow transfer algorithm to match debtors and creditors, reducing total transactions while maintaining feasibility.
-- Recorded and compressed all transactions in a bidirectional matrix to eliminate cycles and optimize settlements.
